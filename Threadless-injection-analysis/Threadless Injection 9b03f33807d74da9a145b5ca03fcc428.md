# Threadless Injection

An practice to reverse analyse the “threadless injection”. Basically threadless injection is to add an API hook to exist process. So the behavior would be the running and legit process initiate and run the shellcode. 

The original ntdll.dll loaded in memory.

After threadless injection is used and hooked ShipAssert export in ntdll.dll in memory of msedge.exe. A opcode call is inserted.

It would lead to an alloc memory space with shellcode loader.

Possible IoC: Memory type is private and with execute and read permission only.

After the hooked WIN32 API is called. The hook is removed.
